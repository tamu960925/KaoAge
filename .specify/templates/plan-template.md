# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: Generated by `/speckit.plan`. Use CLI help for the detailed workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: Kotlin (JVM, Android API 29+) — document deviations explicitly  
**Primary Dependencies**: ML Kit Face Detection (on-device), approved Jetpack libraries  
**ML Outputs**: Face landmarks plus age/gender estimation — document model versions and quality bars  
**Storage**: N/A (SDK MUST NOT persist raw images)  
**Testing**: JUnit + Robolectric (tests written first per TDD)  
**Target Platform**: Android 10+ host app integrating `sdk-core`/`sdk-bestshot`  
**Project Type**: Android SDK modules plus sample cashier app  
**Performance Goals**: e.g., `<100ms` face analysis per frame — update with measured targets  
**Constraints**: On-device only; host app controls camera; parcelables expose toJson()  
**Scale/Scope**: Document integration points, public API surfaces, and sample coverage expectations

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- Kotlin-only source modules with Java interop annotations (`@JvmStatic`, `@JvmOverloads`, builders)
- ML Kit Face Detection selected for all face analytics; no alternative detectors or cloud services
- Age/gender inference uses approved on-device models (via `scripts/download_models.sh`) with documented calibration metrics
- Camera session remains in the host app; plan details frame handoff and BestShot response contract
- SDK outputs parcelable models with `toJson()`, face box, Euler angles, and required landmarks
- External models sourced via `scripts/download_models.sh`, loaded through File/ByteBuffer/AFD paths
- Test plan lists failing JUnit/Robolectric tests to author before any implementation
- New dependencies include documented license review and test coverage strategy
- No image persistence or off-device processing introduced; privacy notes captured for the host app

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the placeholder tree below with the concrete layout
  for this feature. Delete unused options and expand the chosen structure with
  real paths (e.g., apps/admin, packages/something). The delivered plan must
  not include Option labels.

**Structure Decision**: Document module responsibilities (e.g., face detection in
`sdk-core`, heuristics in `sdk-bestshot`, demo flows in `samples/cashier-app`) and
note any additional modules with their justification.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
